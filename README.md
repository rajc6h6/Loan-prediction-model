# ðŸ’¼ Loan Approval Prediction â€“ ML Model by Raj

This project predicts whether a personâ€™s loan will be approved based on input features like income, credit history, employment status, etc. I built the model from scratch â€” cleaned the dataset, handled nulls, encoded features, built a complete pipeline, and deployed it as a Streamlit web app.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** â€“ for data preprocessing
- **scikit-learn** â€“ ML model, pipeline, hyperparameter tuning
- **Streamlit** â€“ to create the interactive web app
- **Joblib** â€“ for model saving/loading

## ðŸš€ What I Did

- Cleaned and explored the loan dataset
- Handled null values and encoded categorical variables
- Used `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` for clean workflow
- Trained a **RandomForestClassifier**
- Tuned hyperparameters with **GridSearchCV**
- Built a user interface using **Streamlit**
- Made the model accessible via a simple web app

## ðŸ“Š Model Accuracy

- Final model accuracy on test set: **~78.9%**
- Model generalizes well â€” no overfitting
